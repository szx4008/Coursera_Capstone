We would find that because of the covid-19, it is hard to go to the city Toronto to do field trip. What we can do is doing research with online database. We must use limited data to generate a reliable conclusion."

On the other hand, we need to show the boss the most intuitive analysis results and convince him, so the choice of our analysis method is very important."

The world’s top companies and more than 150,000 registered developers rely on Foursquare to power geo-tagging, venue search and more in their apps. The Places API offers real-time access to Foursquare’s global database of rich venue data and user content to power your location-based experiences in your app or website. With Places Database, we can access precise, up-to-date community-sourced venue data. The large selection of rich and firmographic location data unlocks the potential to enhance our report with the ability to describe locations, analyze trends.  \n",

    "The theory of our choice is the agglomeration effect. The agglomeration effect refers to the economic effect produced by the spatial concentration of various industries and economic activities and the centripetal force that attracts economic activities to a certain area, which is the basic factor leading to the formation and continuous expansion of cities. The agglomeration effect is a common economic phenomenon, such as the agglomeration effect of industries. The most typical example is the US Silicon Valley, where dozens of global IT giants and countless small and medium high-tech companies have gathered. In Zhejiang, industries such as small household appliances, shoemaking, clothing, button making, and lighters are all concentrated in specific areas, forming a regionally concentrated manufacturing layout. The catering industry is likely to follow this trend. Human flow is a limited resource. This resource is often concentrated in urban areas where the catering industry is developed.  \n",

    "We need to find the area where the restaurant gathers and determine the most suitable location through the clustering effect. By marking all the restaurants in Toronto on the map (Figure 1), we can intuitively find that most of the restaurants are concentrated in the southeast of the city."
